## Hi, I'm Rebecca 👋

I’ve been passionate about science and technology for as long as I can remember.  
After attending an International Scientific High School, I started my journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, with a strong focus on its applications in **healthcare and medicine**.

I’m especially interested in building solutions at the intersection of **AI, data, and medical practice**, where technology can have a real and tangible impact on people’s lives.
