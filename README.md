## Hi, I'm Rebecca! 👋

Ever since I was a child, I have had a strong passion for scientific disciplines. [cite_start]After attending an International Scientific High School, I began my journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence.

I am deeply enthusiastic about AI applications in the medical field, as I find bridging technology and healthcare both challenging and rewarding.
